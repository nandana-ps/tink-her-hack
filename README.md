This project is about a platform which intends to connect the elder citizens of the country to the youth , keeping the idea of time bank . 
A young person can take care of a senior citizen and for that , this young person will receive time into his time bank , which he can use in his old age.
The mechanism is as follows
First , when a user tries to register , they are required to enter their age. And based on this , if the user's age is between 18 and 55 they are referred to as providers and are taken to a youth registration page .
If the user's age is above 55,they are referred to as receivers and are taken to a registration page for the elder citizens.
Based on their entries,their user profile is made.
Based on the services that youth does,their virtual time gets added.
How many points to be added for each work is already defined by the developer.
They can use this time when they become elder citizens.
The most valuable thing  humanbeings can give eachother is their time , an ear to listen and letting them know that they are not alone.
This is the concept of our project GENLINK.
